## By: Nghi Huynh, Minh Mai, Joseph Tran

### Project details
Hello and welcome to our project on Gun Violence within the United States of America!
To get started please open and run the [main](main.py) file. You **will not** need to run the [us_visual](us_visual.py) or [world](world.py) Python files.
The main Python file will take care of everything. 
>Note: In addition to the UW CSE 163 Python libraries ([Conda Environment](https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse163/software/environment.yaml)), we are using Altair,
an advanced data visualization library must be installed prior to running.
Link to [Altair](https://altair-viz.github.io/getting_started/installation.html).

All the necessaray files are already located within the [project_data](./project_data/) folder and ready to go!
All plots will output into the [Output](./Output/) folder. The advanced visualization plots are in a ***.html*** format which
allow for easy access (no special software needed).
>Right Click on these **.html** files and open in your browser!

The other plots can be found as a normal image file ***.png***.
